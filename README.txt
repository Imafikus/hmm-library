The goal of this project was testing of the algorithms which were based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Project consisted of predictions of the next most possible move of an agent in 2D maze, and prediction of a whole sequence of movements in 2D plane For the prediction of next possible state, the biggest achieved accuracy was 64.75%. Prediction of the whole sequence of movements was successful only with constantly changing states. Also, time efficiencies of the singlethreaded and multithreaded implementation of a method were measured and compared. Time efficiency of a multithreaded implementation of a method proved to be better than singlethreaded implementation when working with large matrices. Depending on the operation, multithreaded program was between 1.6 and 8 times faster than singlethreaded program.
